    "description": "A photography license is a contract in which the photographer grants specific rights to the client who wants to use your image(s) for a stipulated amount of time. The client is free to use the photos in any way that doesn't go beyond the scope of the agreement. Sounds simple, right? While there are legalities associated with it, it isn't rocket science. Learn how to license photos, make a contract, grant the client the rights to use your images, and once the contract ends, the client can make no more use your images. The flip-side, however, is that this rarely happens. In most cases, the moment the client receives the images, everything spirals out of control."
